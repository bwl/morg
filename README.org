* Intro

Emacs is +an extensible, customizable text editor+ a framework for creating any text editor you want. The goal of Morg is to build a simple, modern and minimalist Org Mode focused Emacs setup tailored to macOS while following these

** Core principles

1. *Be beginner-friendly*. Anyone should be able to start using Morg just like they can start using VS Code, Sublime, etc.
2. *Respect macOS.* Common system-wide keybindings work as you expect.
3. *Respect Emacs.* Never break vanilla Emacs compatibility. Always provide a way to go "full Emacs" if user so desires.
4. *No layers of complexity.* No custom configuration layers, no DSL, nothing new. Simple =init.el=, packages installed and configured via =use-package=.
5. *Go minimal when possible*. For example, use lightweight =avy= instead of full-featured =Helm=.

* FAQ

*Is Morg compatible with non-macOS systems?*
Maybe! /Nothing/ binds Morg to macOS except for some conventions. As long as you have some key on your keyboard that can play a role of =Super= (e.g. =windows= key), you're good to go.

*I don't know Emacs. Can I use Morg or is it hard?*. You don't need to know Emacs, but it will help. The goal of this project is to make a setup that is suitable for absolute beginners.

*Is this similar to Spacemacs?*
No. Spacemacs is a big, custom distribution with additional layers on top of Emacs. Morg is simply a pre-configured Emacs. You don't need to learn anything new if you know your way around Emacs.

*Will Morg support <something>?*
Probably, unless it goes against the Core Principles. Feel free to open an issue.

*Does this setup work well in the terminal?*
It works, but it is not built for terminal use, since one of the Core Principles is to behave like a native macOS application.

*Why is this project called Morg?*
Mac Org - Simple as that!

*Why was the original prooject called Castlemacs?* See [[#why-this-name][Why this name?]]

*Where do I store my private config?* You can store your regular private config in =private.el=. This file will not be changed in Morg, so you don't have worry about conflicts.

*Why does Morg use the system clipboard separately from the kill ring?* Kill ring system is powerful, but potentially confusing for newcomers. The way it is integrated with the system clipboard by default makes it even more confusing. For these reasons Morg uses the system clipboard only (via the usual macOS key combinations), and keeps the kill ring system independently available to those who want it.

* Installation

** Install Emacs

*Morg requires Emacs 29 or later* for modern features like tree-sitter, eglot (LSP), and pixel-scroll-precision-mode.

*** Recommended: Emacs Plus via Homebrew

[[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] is the best option for Morg. It includes native compilation and tree-sitter by default:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus@30
#+END_SRC

This gives you:
- *Native compilation* for faster startup and execution
- *Tree-sitter* for better syntax highlighting (built-in, cannot be disabled)
- *PATH injection* from your shell (ripgrep, aspell, LSP servers work immediately)
- macOS-specific patches and Emacs.app bundle

After installation, link to Applications:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-plus@30/Emacs.app /Applications
#+END_SRC

*** Alternative: Emacs Mac Port

[[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][Emacs Mac Port]] offers excellent macOS integration:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac
#+END_SRC

This version has superior macOS-native feel (smooth scrolling, emoji, retina) but is based on Emacs 29.

*** Alternative: Download binary

Download from [[https://emacsformacosx.com/][emacsformacosx.com]] - make sure to get version 29+. This is the simplest option but lacks native compilation.

** Install dependencies

Morg relies on [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] to quickly search within a project. Install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install ripgrep
#+END_SRC

Morg requires =aspell=, a Free and Open Source spell checker. Install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install aspell
#+END_SRC

*** Optional: Language Servers for LSP support

Morg includes [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] for Language Server Protocol support. To use it, install language servers for your languages:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Python
pip install python-lsp-server

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript

# Rust
rustup component add rust-analyzer

# Go
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest

# Ruby
gem install solargraph
#+END_SRC

*** Optional: Tree-sitter grammars

Morg uses Emacs 29's built-in tree-sitter for better syntax highlighting. Install grammars with:
=M-x treesit-install-language-grammar=

Common grammars: bash, c, cpp, css, go, html, javascript, json, python, ruby, rust, tsx, typescript, yaml

** Install Morg

Backup current Emacs config (if exists), then clone Morg from Github:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
git clone https://github.com/freetonik/morg ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Launch Emacs and wait for packages to install. On the first launch it will download and install all packages automatically. When done, restart Emacs.

After first launch, run =M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts= to install the icon fonts.

Don't worry about warning messages on the first launch, they will go away after restart.

** Setup keyboard

*I highly recommend changing Caps Lock to Control* by going to System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Modifier Keys. This way you will have a more comfortable Control under your left pinky.

* Usage

** Modifier keys

Morg takes advantage of two facts:

1. =Command= key is used in macOS for all major system shortcuts, so users have muscle memory;
2. Emacs recognizes a =Super= key, but almost never uses it by default.

So, =Command= key becomes =Super=

| Name    | On Mac keyboard | Emacs key |
|---------+-----------------+-----------|
| Super   | Command ⌘       | =s=       |
| Meta    | Left Alt ⌥      | =M=       |
| Control | Control ⌃       | =C=       |

In this document we'll refer to keys with their common macOS names: Cmd, Alt, Ctrl.

** Basics

Basic combinations with =Command= work as expected.

| Binding       | Description              | Emacs default |
|---------------+--------------------------+---------------|
| =Escape=      | Cancel current action    | =C-g=         |
| =Cmd-z=       | Undo                     | =c-_=         |
| =Cmd-Shift-z= | Redo                     | N/A           |
| =Cmd-s=       | Save file                | =C-x C-s=     |
| =Cmd-Shift-s= | Save file as             | =C-x C-w=     |
| =Cmd-o=       | Open file                | =C-x C-f=     |
| =Cmd-a=       | Select whole buffer      | =C-x h=       |
| =Cmd-q=       | Quit Emacs               | =C-x C-c=     |
| =Cmd-Shift-p= | Open command palette     | =M-x=         |
| =Ctrl-x c=    | Open private config file | N/A           |
| =Ctrl-x C=    | Open init config file    | N/A           |

** Navigation

*** Basic movement

Buttons I, J, K, L form a natural alternative to arrow keys. You can move around by holding Cmd while using these keys, without leaving the home row (press Cmd with your right thumb).

(See http://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/ for some background and motivation.)

| Binding | Description | Emacs default | Alternative |
|---------+-------------+---------------+-------------|
| =Cmd-i= | Go up       | =C-p=         | Arrow UP    |
| =Cmd-k= | Go down     | =C-n=         | Arrow DOWN  |
| =Cmd-j= | Go left     | =C-b=         | Arrow LEFT  |
| =Cmd-l= | Go right    | =C-f=         | Arrow RIGHT |

*** Moving text

Hold =Alt= to move current line up or down. This is sometimes called "bubbling".

| Binding    | Description    |
|------------+----------------|
| =Alt-UP=   | Move line up   |
| =Alt-DOWN= | Move line down |

*** Simple jumping within text

=Cmd= or =Fn= with arrows work just like everywhere else in macOS. Holding =Shift= selects the region under movement.

| Binding       | Description            | Emacs default |
|---------------+------------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-LEFT=    | Beginning of line†     | =C-a=         |
| =Cmd-RIGHT=   | End of line            | =C-e=         |
| =Cmd-UP=      | Beginning of buffer    | =M-<=         |
| =Cmd-DOWN=    | End of buffer          | =M->=         |
| =Fn-UP=       | Page up                | =C-v=         |
| =Fn-DOWN=     | Page down              | =M-v=         |
| =Fn-Alt-UP=   | Page up other window   | =C-M-v=       |
| =Fn-Alt-DOWN= | Page down other window | =C-M-S-v=     |

† "Beginning of line" is a smart command. It moves cursor to the first non-whitespace character. Press it again, and it moves cursor to the real beginning of line. You can keep pressing it to jump cursor between those two positions.

*** Smart jumping within buffer and between buffers

Many commands in Emacs write the current position into a mark ring. For example, if you were editing line 6, then performed a search with =Cmd+f=, did something and want to come back, press =Cmd+,= to go back to line 6. =Cmd+.= to go forward.

| Binding | Description        | Emacs default |
|---------+--------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-⸴=  | Go to prev. mark   | =C-u SPC=     |
| =Cmd-.= | Go to next mark    | N/A           |
| =Cmd-<= | Go to prev. buffer | =C-x LEFT=    |
| =Cmd->= | Go to next buffer  | =C-x RIGHT=   |

Holding =Shift= 'lifts' the meaning of this movement, and instead of jumping to a previous/next position in the current buffer, it jumps to a previous/next buffer in current window.

** Search and replace

| Binding     | Description    | Emacs default |
|-------------+----------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-f=     | Search in file | =C-s=         |
| =Cmd-r=     | Visual replace | N/A           |
| =Cmd-Alt-f= | Visual replace | N/A           |

[[./screenshots/replace.png]]

** Editing

*** Words and lines

| Binding         | Description                                     | Emacs default |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-RET=       | New line below                                  | N/A           |
| =Cmd-Shift-RET= | New line above                                  | N/A           |
| =Cmd-/=         | Comment line                                    | =C-x C-;=     |
| =Cmd-j=         | Join with next line or join all lines in region | N/A           |
| =Alt-u=         | Upcase current word or region                   | =M-u (same)=  |
| =Alt-l=         | Downcase current word or region                 | =M-l (same)=  |
| =Alt-c=         | Capitalize word                                 | =M-c (same)=  |

*** Deleting text

| Binding               | Description           | Emacs default |
|-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------|
| =Alt-BACKSPACE=       | Delete word backwards | N/A           |
| =Alt-Shift-BACKSPACE= | Delete word forwards  | =M-d=         |
| =Cmd-BACKSPACE=       | Delete current line   | N/A           |
| =Ctrl-k=              | Delete to end of line | =Ctrl-k=      |
| =Ctrl-d=              | Delete character      | =Ctrl-d=      |


*** Multiple cursors

| Binding       | Description                       |
|---------------+-----------------------------------|
| =Cmd-d=       | Select next occurrence†           |
| =Cmd-Shift-d= | Select all occurrences            |
| =Alt-Cmd-d=   | Add cursor to each line in region |

† When no text is selected, =Cmd-d= adds new cursor to the next line.

While multiple cursors are active:

| Binding              | Description                                |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| =C-g= or =ESC=       | Quit multiple cursors mode                 |
| =Ctrl-’=             | Hide/show lines where cursors are active   |
| =Ctrl-v= and =Alt-v= | Scroll the screen to center on each cursor |

Learn about all features of multiple cursors at https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el

*** Indentation

Emacs is pretty good at indenting stuff automatically. Pressing =TAB= on a line or region will indent it as needed. Morg assumes that we never use tabs, only spaces, and use 2 spaces by default in most languages.

| Binding   | Description                                  |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------|
| =TAB=     | Indent current line or region correctly      |
| =C-x TAB= | Rigidly change indentation of line or region |


*** Region

Command with apostrophe expands selection. Holding shift contracts it.

| Binding       | Description     |
|---------------+-----------------|
| =Cmd-’=       | Expand region   |
| =Cmd-Shift-’= | Contract region |

** Window Management

Note that in Emacs-talk, a pane is called a =window=.

*** Splitting windows

These bindings are based on default Emacs conventions, but save you one keypress. Also, =Cmd-w= closes current window just like a browser tab.

| Binding | Description         | Emacs default |
|---------+---------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-1= | Kill other windows  | =C-x 1=       |
| =Cmd-2= | Split horizontally  | =C-x 2=       |
| =Cmd-3= | Split vertically    | =C-x 3=       |
| =Cmd-0= | Kill current window | =C-x 0=       |
| =Cmd-w= | Kill current window | =C-x 0=       |

*** Moving between windows

Move left and right just like in iTerm. Hold shift to make it up and down.

| Binding       | Description | Alternative      |
|---------------+-------------+------------------|
| =Cmd-[=       | Move left   | =Ctrl-Cmd-LEFT=  |
| =Cmd-]=       | Move right  | =Ctrl-Cmd-RIGHT= |
| =Cmd-Shift-[= | Move up     | =Ctrl-Cmd-UP=    |
| =Cmd-Shift-]= | Move down   | =Ctrl-Cmd-DOWN=  |

*** Restoring window configuration

This is =winner-mode=. It captures the current window configuration and allows you to restore it after it gets changed by some Emacs action.

| Binding     | Description                             | Emacs default |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-Alt-[= | Restore previous configuration          | C-c LEFT      |
| =Cmd-Alt-]= | Go to next configuration (undo restore) | C-c RIGHT     |

** Project Management


Morg uses [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] for project management. There are a lot of features, and most of them are discoverable from the so-called "command map".

| Binding          | Description                 | Emacs default |
|------------------+-----------------------------+---------------|
| =Ctrl-Cmd-p=     | Open projectile command map | =C-c p=       |
| =Ctrl-Cmd-p= =p= | Switch project              | =C-c p p=     |
| =Cmd-p=          | Find file in project        | =C-c p f=     |
| =Cmd-Shift-f=    | Search in project           | =C-c p s s=   |

Note that 'Emacs default' doesn't make much sense in this context, since Projectile is not part of Emacs. I try to provide commonly used combinations for these cases: =C-c p= is what Projectile's author suggests, for example, and many configs follow this suggestion.

While in search mode:

| Binding      | Description               |
|--------------+---------------------------|
| =Ctrl-Alt-m= | Preview current file      |
| =Ctrl-Alt-n= | Next file and preview     |
| =Ctrl-Alt-p= | Previous file and preview |
| =ESC=        | Quit search               |

** Git

*** Git gutter

Changes to the current file are shown in the gutter on left side. You can change the appearance of those symbols: search for =git-gutter= section in =init.el=. To see a list of all available colors run =Alt-x counsel-colors-emacs=. See [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter][Git-gutter docs]] for more info.

[[./screenshots/git_gutter.png]]

*** Magit

Morg uses [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]], a wonderful package that aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.

| Binding | Description  |
|---------+--------------|
| =Cmd-g= | Magit status |

From this status window you can do everything. Here are the basic commands available within Magit status window:

| Binding | Description                 |
|---------+-----------------------------|
| =s=     | Stage current file or chunk |
| =c=     | Open commit window          |
| =F=     | Open pull window            |
| =P=     | Open push window            |

There are cheat sheets available within Magit. Refer to [[https://magit.vc/manual/][Magit User Manuals]] for more info.

** Terminal (shell)

There is a toggleable popup shell which is actually a full blown terminal emulator (=ansi-term=). It uses your system default shell and loads the appropriate environment.

| Binding | Description  |
|---------+--------------|
| =Cmd-== | Toggle shell |

** File tree and open buffers

| Binding         | Description                                  |
|-----------------+----------------------------------------------|
| =Cmd-b=         | Switch to another buffer or open recent file |
| =Cmd-Shift-b-== | Toggle filetree                              |

** Programming

*** Languages and modes

Emacs supports many programming languages by default. Morg adds support for YAML, Markdown, Web mode (HTML, CSS, PHP, templating, etc), Emmet, and includes tree-sitter and LSP (via eglot) support for enhanced language intelligence.

Feel free to add more features by sending a PR or opening an issue.

*** Code completion

Code completion popup shows up immediately when possible. When popup is active:

| Binding     | Description                               |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
| =Enter=     | Select current candidate                  |
| =Alt-DIGIT= | Quickly complete with one of first 10     |
| =TAB=       | Complete common part                      |
| =F1=        | Show documentation for selected candidate |
| =Ctrl-w=    | Show source for selected candidate        |
|             |                                           |

Note that not all backends support the last two commands.

This feature is provided by Company mode package. Learn more about Company mode at http://company-mode.github.io/

*** Emmet

| Binding                  | Description  |
|--------------------------+--------------|
| =Ctrl-Enter= or =Ctrl-j= | Expand Emmet |

Learn more about [[https://github.com/smihica/emmet-mode][emmet mode]].

** Spellchecking, thesaurus, definition

*** Spellchecking

Spellchecking requires an external command to be available. See [[#install-dependencies][Install dependencies]].

| Binding       | Description                    | Emacs default |
|---------------+--------------------------------+---------------|
| =Cmd-\=       | Correct current word via popup | N/A           |
| =Cmd-Ctlr-\=  | Correct current word via list  | =M-$=         |

The last three lines in the popup allow to add current word to your personal dictionary or accept it as correct for current session (as long as Emacs is open) or current buffer.

When correcting via list, you can press =i= to quickly add the word to your personal dictionary.

mkdir -p ~/org/roam/daily ~/org/roam/references ~/org/roam/projects ~/org/images
touch ~/org/inbox.org ~/org/journal.org

If you use Dropbox or similar cloud provider, I suggest storing your actual org folder there, and providing a symlink:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ln -s ~/Dropbox/Org ~/org
#+END_SRC


* Why this name?

*Morg* = *M*ac + *Org*. Simple as that!

This project was originally called *Castlemacs*, which referenced the Command key (⌘) used heavily on macOS. The ⌘ symbol is a 'looped square' known as /the place of interest sign/, derived from the shape of a castle (like Borgholm Castle in Sweden).
